# Introduction #

Hello, I'm Willems Cyril. I'm curently studying biology and as parts of my studies, i have to write a blog about a subject of my choice.

So for my blog, i decided to speak about the mezosoic era, some great discover we have done recently and the end of this era. First i will speak about each parts of this era (3) and we will see that it was significantly different that nowaday.

But why i chose this subject ? 

the main reason is because i find that very interesting and a slighly more scientific reason is that we can learn about the past to better known the futur.

I hope you like the subject as well as me and happy reading!
